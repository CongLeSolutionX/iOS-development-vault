# The Objective-C View Controller - The standalone view controller

```

### Explanation of the View Lifecycle Steps:

1. **`initWithNibName:bundle:`**
    - Initializes the view controller with a nib file and bundle.
2. **`loadView`**
    - Loads or creates a view hierarchy programmatically.
3. **`viewDidLoad`**
    - Called after the view has been loaded. Suitable for additional setup after loading the view.
4. **`viewWillAppear:`**
    - Invoked just before the view is added to the app’s view hierarchy.
5. **`viewWillLayoutSubviews`**
    - Called before the view lays out its subviews. Ideal for making changes before layout.
6. **`viewDidLayoutSubviews`**
    - Called after the view lays out its subviews. Suitable for additional layout adjustments.
7. **`viewDidAppear:`**
    - Invoked after the view has been added to the view hierarchy. Good for starting animations or tracking view appearance.
8. **`User Interaction`**
    - Represents the period where the user interacts with the view.
9. **`viewWillDisappear:`**
    - Called just before the view is removed from the view hierarchy.
10. **`viewDidDisappear:`**
    - Invoked after the view has been removed from the view hierarchy. Suitable for stopping services that don’t need to run when the view isn’t visible.
11. **`dealloc`**
    - Called when the view controller is about to be deallocated. Used for cleanup tasks.

### Additional Tips:

- **Debugging Lifecycle Issues:**
    - Understanding the lifecycle is crucial for debugging issues related to view loading, memory management, and resource handling.
- **Best Practices:**
    - **`viewDidLoad`:** Ideal for initializing data structures, setting up observers, and preparing the UI.
    - **`viewWillAppear:` and `viewDidAppear:`:** Useful for starting animations, network requests, or tracking analytics.
    - **`viewWillDisappear:` and `viewDidDisappear:`:** Good for saving state, stopping services, or cleaning up resources.
- **Memory Management:**
    - Ensure that you manage memory effectively in `dealloc` to prevent memory leaks, especially when dealing with observers or notifications.

This diagram serves as a quick reference to understand the sequence and purpose of each method in the Objective-C view controller lifecycle, aiding in better application architecture and maintenance.
