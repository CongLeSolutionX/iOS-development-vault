This diagram attempts to provide a holistic view, showing that patterns are not isolated tools but interconnected parts of a larger design vocabulary used to build robust and maintainable software, particularly within the context of iOS development.


This diagram aims to illustrate:

1.  **Categorization:** Grouping patterns by their primary intent (Creational, Structural, Behavioral, Memory).
2.  **Core Relationships:** How patterns commonly interact (e.g., composition, implementation assistance).
3.  **Alternatives/Choices:** Showing where patterns offer different solutions to similar problems.
4.  **Problem/Solution:** Highlighting specific problems (like Retain Cycles) and the patterns/techniques that address them.
5.  **Refinement:** Indicating when one pattern is a specialization of another.
6.  **iOS Context:** Implicitly referencing iOS scenarios where patterns are common (though labels are kept general for broader applicability).

Due to the density of information required in a single diagram, clarity is prioritized over exhaustive detail for every possible nuanced connection. Key relationships highlighted in the previous diagrams are central here.

**Explanation of the Diagram's Structure and Connections:**

1.  **Starting Point:** Begins with identifying a design problem, leading to categorization.
2.  **Categories (Subgraphs):** Patterns are grouped logically (Creational, Structural, Behavioral, Memory). Architecture and related concepts are in a separate subgraph.
3.  **Pattern Nodes & Descriptions:** Each pattern has a main node (Abbreviation) linked (`-->`) to a node with a brief description or primary use case.
4.  **Intra-Category Links (`-.->`, `--`):**
    *   Shows relationships *within* a category (e.g., Abstract Factory often uses Factory Methods, Builder refined by Builder with Options).
    *   Implementation details are shown (e.g., Prototype uses `NSCopying`/`clone()`, Iterator uses `IteratorProtocol`).
    *   Use cases specific to iOS are noted (e.g., Composite -> UIView, Adapter -> Bridging).
5.  **Inter-Category Links (`-.->`):** These are crucial for showing the roadmap connections:
    *   **Structural supporting Behavioral:** Decorator wraps Components (often Composites); Visitor operates on Composites; Iterator traverses Composites.
    *   **Creational supporting Structural/Behavioral:** Facades/Singletons provide access points; Flyweight uses Factories.
    *   **Behavioral needing Memory Mgmt:** Observer implementations (delegates, closures) often require `weak` references to prevent Retain Cycles.
    *   **Memory Mgmt addressing Issues:** Retain Cycles are a problem arising from ARC/MRC, solved by `weak`/`unowned`.
    *   **Dependency Injection:** Supported by Creational patterns, fundamental to good Architecture.
    *   **Architecture relies on Patterns:** The Architecture subgraph shows that larger architectures are *implemented using* various design patterns from all categories.
    *   **Anti-Patterns:** Linked from patterns prone to misuse (Singleton, Mediator, Observer).
6.  **Line Styles (Conceptual):** While basic Mermaid has limited built-in line style variation, the comments (`%%`) suggest intended meanings: Solid for primary links, Dashed for conceptual/supporting roles, Dotted for refinement/implementation details.
7.  **Styling:** Consistent colors are used for subgraph backgrounds/borders and key node types to aid visual grouping.
