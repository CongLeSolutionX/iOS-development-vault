  <blockquote>
  As a visual learner student, I created these personal study notes from the cited source(s) to aid my understanding.<br/>
  While my firm intention is to provide full credit, the blended format of notes and diagrams may sometimes obscure the original source, for which I apologize.<br/>
  I am committed to making corrections and welcome any feedback.<br/>
  This is a non-commercial project for my humble educational purposes only since the start.<br/>
  My goal is to share my perspective and contribute to the great work already being done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I want to extend my genuine apologies to the creators of the original material.<br/>
  Their work was the direct inspiration for this project, and I adapted it without first reaching out.<br/>
  My intent comes from a place of deep respect, and I hope this is received in the spirit of homage.<br/>
