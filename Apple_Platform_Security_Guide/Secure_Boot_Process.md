## Explanation

*   **Power On (A):** The device's power is switched on.
*   **Boot ROM (B):** The initial, immutable code loaded from the chip's read-only memory. This code is considered the hardware root of trust.
*   **Verify iBoot Signature (C):** The Boot ROM checks if the iBoot bootloader, the next stage in the boot process, is signed by Apple.
    *   **Yes (C --> D):** If verified, iBoot is loaded into memory.
    *   **No (C --> E):** If not verified, the device enters DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode.  This mode is designed for recovery and update processes.
*   **Load iBoot (D):** iBoot is loaded into memory.
*   **Verify iOS/iPadOS Kernel Signature (F):** iBoot checks if the iOS or iPadOS kernel is signed by Apple.
    *   **Yes (F --> G):** If verified, the kernel is loaded.
    *   **No (F --> H):** If not verified, the device enters Recovery mode, a more advanced recovery mode than DFU.
*   **Load iOS/iPadOS Kernel (G):** The iOS or iPadOS kernel is loaded into memory.
*   **Initialize Kernel (I):** The kernel begins its initialization process.
*   **Check for Cellular Baseband (J):** The process checks for cellular functionality.
    *   **Yes (J --> K):** If cellular is present, the cellular baseband firmware is loaded and verified.
    *   **No (J --> L):** If cellular isn't present, the boot process continues with initialization.
*   **Load Cellular Baseband Firmware (K):** The necessary cellular baseband firmware is loaded and verified.
*   **Device Ready (N):** The device is now fully initialized and ready for user interaction.
*   **Recovery Mode Options (M):** If the signature verification fails at any stage, the device enters Recovery mode.  This provides user options to restore the device to a known good state.



This flowchart provides a simplified view of the process.  Each stage involves cryptographic checks to maintain a chain of trust.  Error paths, such as DFU and Recovery modes, are crucial for troubleshooting and restoring devices to a functional state.
